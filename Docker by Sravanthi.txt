Virtualisation with Hypervisor:
==============================
Virtualisation is nothing but exposing or creating IT services using software and hardware resources on the physical server make 
available to users and applications to multiple environments on the compute cloud or cloud environment.
1.Hypervisor is a software installed on top of the physical serveron and used to create VMs where we run workloads inside the VMs.
2.There are two types of hypervisors:
  1.Hardware Hypervisor also known as Native or Bare-Metal Hypervisor.
  2.Software Hypervisor also known as Host OS Hypervisor.
3.Difference between two hypervisors:
 1.Hardware hypervisor vitualise hardware resources and software hypervisor virtualise software like OS. The name itself 
defines the deifference b/w two hypervisors.
 2.Hardware hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server whereas software hypervisor is installed on top the host 
   operating system on the physical server.
 3.Hardware hypervisor has direct access to the hardware resources on the physical server and host OS.whereas in software 
   hypervisor we make use of the host OS with the seperate guest os installed on VMs to communicate with the resources on 
   the physical server.
 4.There is a drawback with type2 hypervisor.If the host OS goes down with any issue the entire hypervisor,VM's goes down and 
   The status of workloads wil also be down.There is a risk of losing entire data on VM if OS crashes down. 
Limitations of Hyperviosor:
==========================
1.Monitoring or provisioning VM is a time consuming process compared to containers.
2.Allocation of resources is not dynamic.
3.When resources are allocated to the VMs,major portion of the resource utilization is consumed by OS and the least portion which
  is left consumed by an application which makes application process slow.
4.we can run no of Vms on the single piece of pyshical infracture but lesser compared to containers
5.On pysical server we install one OS and run multiple applications whereas in VMs we install different or same guest OS on 
  every VM to run workloads for different purpose.
SETUP OR CREATE VM USING HYPERVISOR:
===================================
Note:Here in the example I'm using type2 hypervisor and unbuntu OS with the version 22.04 LTS.Always prefer Ubuntu 18,20,22 LTS(Long Term Service)
for production level services.Ubuntu with version 21 for testing purpose.
->>Architecture: X86_64(amd64),arm64,armhf and s390x.
->>We have multiple types of type2 hypervisor like VM Ware workstation, Oracle Solaris Zones,Oracle VM Server for x86,VMware Fusion
   etc.Here in the example I have taken Oracle VirtualBox.
->>In Ubuntu OS we create additional user and password to login VM whereas in other OS like redhat,federo etc we create password 
   for the root user.Not required of addtional user to be created.

1.Goto the browser and search for Oracle VM Box with version 7.0.6.It is type2 hypervisor which is installed on windows host OS 
  on the physical server.
2.Once you click on the download link exe.file executes on your windows local system.Double click on the exe file of VM Box.
  Follow the instructions and perform installation process.
3.Once installation process has been completed,open VM box and start creating VMs with help of the type2 hypervisor Oracle 
  VirtualBox.
4.Now goto browser and search for an OS to be installed on VM as Guest OS.Select Platform according to your base system 
  requirements and Download latest version.Here in the expample I have taken Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
5.Download ISO image file of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on your windows local system.
6.Open VM Box, select machine then new to create VM on VM Box.Give machine name and select ISO file path where Ubuntu image is 
  downloaded and click next.Configure your VM during installation process.
7.Once VM installed successfully reboot the system.First we need to login with user and password which we add during installation
  process then we switch to root user.
8.Once VM with Ubuntu OS is created.We install docker to create containers to run workloads inside the containers.
Docker:
======
Containerisation Tool:
Docker is one of the containerisation platform tools introduced as open-source in 2013 and written in go language which is freely 
available in the market.Docker is a software installed on Vms to create containers to run workloads. Docker is used to build,test,
deploy an application faster on a single platform compared to other software developement traditional approach.We need not install 
any seperate OS on docker as it makes use of kernel packages and system resources to run workloads insdie the container.Ther is no 
burden of additional software installation process like guest OS which makes containers provide light-weight environment throughout 
the lifecycle.It makes container portable which hepls us to migrate from one platform to another platform easily.Container is a 
pre-installed box bundled with libraries,packages,dependencies,software code,app code etc. which are required to run OS and 
application on container and deploys application faster.

WHAT ARE THE KERNEL PACKAGES AND USES?
=====================================
1.Computers can only read binary language.They do not understand human readable launguage.The kernel in linux system acts as an
  interpreter between the user and application or system.
2.The job of kernel is to convert the binary language into human readable language and viceversa.
3.Kernel packages are nothing but Namespaces and Cgroups(Contrl Groups).These are the existing features of linux OS since it
  is introduced.
4.The job of kernel packages is to communicate with system's hardware and resources like CPU,memory,storage.
5.It sits between applications and harware resources to make connection of all your application software to hardware to perform 
  tasks.
6.Namespaces are used to create an isolation between the applications and containers running on the same host OS.Cgroups are used
  to manage resources like CPU,memory,storage allocated to applications.
7.Docker uses these kernel packages of linux system to communicate with hardware resources on the physical server.
8.Docker does not install any kernel packages.It makes use of kernel packages of linux system to create isloation between containers
  and resouce management.

PRE REQUISITE STEPS TO INSTALL DOCKER:
=====================================
1.Make sure what kind of OS version we need for the linux system.
2.Achitecture which is required.
3.We need to delete the previous version of docker which is already installed before you install the new one.
4.Delete the folders like docker.io,/var/lib/docker,docker-ce,docker compose,docker-cli. 
5.Uninstall docker packages and docker engine.
Docker Installation Process:
===========================
Installations Methods:
===================== 
There are three types of installation methods:
1.Docker installation from apt docker repository which is also known as package manager.
2.Manual installation process using "DEB" packages.
3.Conventional Script.
Steps before install Docker:
=======================
1.First we need to create Keyrings directory under /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg/
2.We need to download GPG key under the specific directory.
3.Create the docker repository under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
4.Download docker packages under the specified directiory. It is also known as package management.
DOCKER ENGINE STEUP:
===================
-> Goto official Docker website https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
-> Select the OS platform if it ubuntu,Federos,Redhat etc.
-> Take the latest or previous version of OS according to your system requirement or client requirement.
